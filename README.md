# HealthBuddy
HealthBuddy is a web-based platform designed to make the entire process of the health center of IITK paper-less. It has separate endpoints for various departments like reception, doctor, user, pharmacy, etc. The idea is to digitize the health center's record-keeping process and make the whole process smooth and convenient for both patients and staff. The user end also has features like reminders for future doctor visits, timings of doctors, setting up appointments, etc. This also helps doctors as the entire medical history their patient will be just a few clicks away.
